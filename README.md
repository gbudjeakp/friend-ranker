# friend-ranker
A friend ranking application that let's you put your friends in their place.

# It's Open Source
This is an open source project?? I guess? LOL if you see this and you're curious, feel free to reach out to me for more details. 
I'll be updating this as much as I can. A Low Level Design should be out sometime when I'm free lol. In the mean time, checkout the current design. 
Feel free to suggest improvements. Design is subject to change as more research is done.


## High Level Design
This is a rough high level design of the friend ranker application.

## How to contribute
Interested in helping out build this out? 
First clone the `development branch` repository to your local environment  by entering 

`git clone {development branch url/ssh} `

# For Front-End Development
Next open the repo in your IDE. Then change directories to `client` if you want to work on the front-end part of things and enter 

`yarn start`

to start up the react side of things. The project will be done in TypeScript so keep that in mind.

# For Back-End Development
There is nothing for the back-end template as of yet. This will be updated as time goes on.
